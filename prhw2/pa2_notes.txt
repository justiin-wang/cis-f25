Workflow:
0. We have C_exp and C_measured
1. Transform into same frame to computer C_exp. Create an array of corresponding "errors". Note: EM distortion is primarily tranlsation, so 3 vectors. No rotation
2. Model errors with polynomial fitting (bpoly?)
3. Interpolate and apply corrections 
4. Do pivot calibration with corrections for distortion
5.
